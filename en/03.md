## 3 Business Layer

We have created a simple business layer in the [sample project](https://github.com/riganti/dotvvm-hands-on-lab). The project is named `DotvvmBlog.BL` and contains all functions we will need in our blog site.

It is a good practise not to pass Entity Framework entities in the presentation layer (which is the DotVVM application). The user interface should use the DTOs (Data Transfer Object), which follow these guidelines:

* _JSON Serializable_: DotVVM needs to serialize the viewmodel in the JSON format. Entity Framework entities typically contain reference cycles which is not supported in JSON.

* _No DbContext dependencies_: Entity Framework context tracks all entities it created and watch them for changes or performs the lazy loading. 

* _Only properties acutally needed by the UI_: DTOs should contain only the properties that are really needed in the view. It is not a good idea to expose the `User` entity with the `Password` column in the top layer of youre application.  

That's why the business layer contains the `DTO` folder. DTOs have only public properties. There is no busines logic. Each DTO is designed to perfectly match the UI. You can have multiple DTOs for each database table, there is nothing wrong about it. The idea is to have a specialized DTO for every "view" of the entity.

The business layer also contains the `Services` folder, which contains several classes with methods we will need. For example, there is a class named `HomepageService` with the `GetRecentArticles` method. This method returns a list of recent articles with all the information we will need.

### 3.1 Create Project

> Add another project of type *Windows Classic Desktop > Class Library* in the solution and name it `DotvvmBlog.BL`.

> Copy the `Services` and `DTO` from the [sample project](https://github.com/riganti/dotvvm-hands-on-lab) directory `sample\DotvvmBlog.BL`.

> In the *Package Manager Console* window, choose the `DotvvmBlog.BL` as a *default project* and execute the following command: `Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework`.

> Next, right click the `DotvvmBlog.BL` project and choose `Add / Reference`.

> Choose the *Project* tab and check the `DotvvmBlog.DAL` project.

## 3.2 Add References in DotVVM Project

We also need to reference the DAL and BL projects from our DotVVM project.

> Right-click the `DotvvmBlog` project and add a reference to the `DotvvmBlog.BL` project.

> In the *Package Manager Console* window, select `DotvvmBlog` as a *default project* and execute the following command:

```
Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework
```

The last thing we need to do is to install the `DotVVM.Core` package in the business layer. This package contains several DotVVM-related interfaces and attributes which may be useful in the business layer. 

> Open the `DotvvmBlog\packages.config` file and look for the version of the `DotVVM.Core` package.

> In the *Package Manager Console* window, select the `DotvvmBlog.BL` as the *default project* and execute the following command. Substitute `XXX` with the same version you have found in the `packages.config` file.

```
Install-Package DotVVM.Core -version XXX
```

> Make sure that all projects in the solution use the same version of .NET Framework (e.g. 4.5.2). Double-click the *Properties* node in every project and you will be able to change the .NET Framework version.

> Try to compile the project (choose the *Build* item in the *Project* menu).
